        <strong>Our History</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        R&P Plastics, LLC, a family-owned and operated business, was established
        in Worcester, MA in 1999. After working in the plastics industry for
        over 25 years, John the owner, decided to go into business for himself.
        He began by leasing a small 7,000 sq. ft. facility with only 4
        extruders. Currently R&P Plastic's production line utilizes more than 20
        pieces of equipment ranging from extruders to bag machines. In 2007,
        operations moved into our 50,000 sq. ft. facility, which is the
        company's current location in Winchendon, MA.<br />
